# vim-cycle-airline-theme

Modified from the source code of the [CycleColor](https://github.com/vim-scripts/CycleColor) plugin, this plugin provides a function to cycle through available airline themes if you have installed [vim-airline-themes](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline-themes). It includes themes from all `/autoload/airline/themes/*.vim` subdirectories in the runtimepath.

## Usage

F4 to move to the next theme in path and F3 to move backwards.
